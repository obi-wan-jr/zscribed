When the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke; and the multitudes marveled.\nBut some of them said, “He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.”\nOthers, testing him, sought from him a sign from heaven.\nBut he, knowing their thoughts, said to them,\n“Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. A house divided against itself falls.\n\n\nIf Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.\n\n\nBut if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore will they be your judges.\n\n\nBut if I by God’s finger cast out demons, then God’s Kingdom has come to you.\n\n“When the strong man, fully armed, guards his own dwelling, his goods are safe.\n\n\nBut when someone stronger attacks him and overcomes him, he takes from him his whole armor in which he trusted, and divides his plunder.\n\n\n“He that is not with me is against me.

Therefore when your eye is good, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness.\n\n\nTherefore see whether the light that is in you isn’t darkness.\n\n\nIf therefore your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light.”\nNow as he spoke, a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him.

For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.\n\n\nSo you testify and consent to the works of your fathers. For they killed them, and you build their tombs.\n\n\nTherefore also the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles; and some of them they will kill and persecute,\n\n\nthat the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;\n\n\nfrom the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary.’ Yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.\n\n\nWoe to you lawyers!

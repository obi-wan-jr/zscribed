The Levites were counted from thirty years old and upward; and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty-eight thousand. David said, \"Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of The LORD’s house, six thousand were officers and judges, four thousand were doorkeepers, and four thousand praised The LORD with the instruments which I made for giving praise.\" David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei. The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, Zetham, and Joel, three. The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers’ households of Ladan. The sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei. Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah didn’t have many sons; therefore they became a fathers’ house in one reckoning.

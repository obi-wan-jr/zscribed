She isn’t dead, but sleeping.”\nThey were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead.\nBut he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he called, saying,\n“Child, arise!”\nHer spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat.\nHer parents were amazed, but he commanded them to tell no one what had been done.\n",

What evil has he done?”\nBut they cried out exceedingly, saying, “Let him be crucified!”\nSo when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it.”\nAll the people answered, “May his blood be on us, and on our children!”\nThen he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified.\nThen the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against him.\nThey stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him.\nThey braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”\nThey spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.\nWhen they had mocked him, they took the robe off him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.\nAs they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, and they compelled him to go with them, that he might carry his cross.\nWhen they came to a place called “Golgotha”, that is to say, “The place of a skull,”\nthey gave him sour wine to drink mixed with gall. When he had tasted it, he would not drink.\nWhen they had crucified him, they divided his clothing among them, casting lots,\nand they sat and watched him there.\nThey set up over his head the accusation against him written, “THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.”\nThen there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one on the left.\nThose who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads,\nand saying, “You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!”\nLikewise the chief priests also mocking, with the scribes, the Pharisees, and the elders, said,\n“He saved others, but he can’t save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.\nHe trusts in God. Let God deliver him now, if he wants him; for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”\nThe robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach.\nNow from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.\nAbout the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,\n“Eli, Eli, lima\nsabachthani?”\n That is,\n“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”\nSome of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, “This man is calling Elijah.”\nImmediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a drink.\nThe rest said, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to save him.”\nJesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.\nBehold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were split.\nThe tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;\nand coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.\nNow the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, “Truly this was the Son of God.”\nMany women were there watching from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him.\nAmong them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.\nWhen evening had come, a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who himself was also Jesus’ disciple came.\nThis man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up.\nJoseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,\nand laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone against the door of the tomb, and departed.\nMary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.\nNow on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,\nsaying, “Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was still alive: ‘After three days I will rise again.’\nCommand therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away, and tell the people, ‘He is risen from the dead;’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.”\nPilate said to them, “You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you can.”\nSo they went with the guard and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone.\n",

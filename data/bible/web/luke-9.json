Listen to him!”\nWhen the voice came, Jesus was found alone. They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which they had seen.\nOn the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.\nBehold, a man from the crowd called out, saying, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.\nBehold, a spirit takes him, he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams, and it hardly departs from him, bruising him severely.\nI begged your disciples to cast it out, and they couldn’t.”\nJesus answered,\n“Faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.”\nWhile he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.\nThey were all astonished at the majesty of God.\nBut while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,\n\n“Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men.”\nBut they didn’t understand this saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.\nThere arose an argument among them about which of them was the greatest.\nJesus, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child, and set him by his side,\nand said to them,\n“Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least among you all, this one will be great.”\nJohn answered, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he doesn’t follow with us.”\nJesus said to him,\n“Don’t forbid him, for he who is not against us is for us.”\nIt came to pass, when the days were near that he should be taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem,\nand sent messengers before his face. They went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for him.\nThey didn’t receive him, because he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem.\nWhen his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky, and destroy them, just as Elijah did?”\nBut he turned and rebuked them,\n“You don’t know of what kind of spirit you are.\n\n\nFor the Son of Man didn’t come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them.”\nThey went to another village.\nAs they went on the way, a certain man said to him, “I want to follow you wherever you go, Lord.”\nJesus said to him,\n“The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”\nHe said to another,\n“Follow me!”\nBut he said, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.”\nBut Jesus said to him,\n“Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and announce God’s Kingdom.”\nAnother also said, “I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow me to say good-bye to those who are at my house.”\nBut Jesus said to him,\n“No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for God’s Kingdom.”\n",

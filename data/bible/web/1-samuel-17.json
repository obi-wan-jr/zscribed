Is there not a cause?”\nHe turned away from him toward another, and spoke like that again; and the people answered him again the same way.\nWhen the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him.\nDavid said to Saul, “Let no man’s heart fail because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.”\nSaul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.”\nDavid said to Saul, “Your servant was keeping his father’s sheep; and when a lion or a bear came, and took a lamb out of the flock,\nI went out after him, and struck him, and rescued it out of his mouth. When he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and struck him, and killed him.\nYour servant struck both the lion and the bear. This uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, since he has defied the armies of the living God.”\nDavid said, “Yahweh who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.”\nSaul said to David, “Go! Yahweh will be with you.”\nSaul dressed David with his clothing. He put a helmet of brass on his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail.\nDavid strapped his sword on his clothing, and he tried to move; for he had not tested it. David said to Saul, “I can’t go with these; for I have not tested them.” Then David took them off.\nHe took his staff in his hand, and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the pouch of his shepherd’s bag which he had. His sling was in his hand; and he came near to the Philistine.\nThe Philistine walked and came near to David; and the man who bore the shield went before him.\nWhen the Philistine looked around, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and had a good looking face.\nThe Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” The Philistine cursed David by his gods.\nThe Philistine said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky, and to the animals of the field.”\nThen David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin; but I come to you in the name of Yahweh of Armies, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.\nToday, Yahweh will deliver you into my hand. I will strike you, and take your head from off you. I will give the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines today to the birds of the sky, and to the wild animals of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,\nand that all this assembly may know that Yahweh doesn’t save with sword and spear; for the battle is Yahweh’s, and he will give you into our hand.”\nWhen the Philistine arose, and walked and came near to meet David, David hurried, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.\nDavid put his hand in his bag, took a stone, and slung it, and struck the Philistine in his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth.\nSo David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine, and killed him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.\nThen David ran, stood over the Philistine, took his sword, drew it out of its sheath, killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.\nThe men of Israel and of Judah arose and shouted, and pursued the Philistines as far as Gai and to the gates of Ekron. The wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath and to Ekron.\nThe children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines and they plundered their camp.\nDavid took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.\nWhen Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the army, “Abner, whose son is this youth?”\nAbner said, “As your soul lives, O king, I can’t tell.”\nThe king said, “Inquire whose son the young man is!”\nAs David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.\nSaul said to him, “Whose son are you, you young man?”\nDavid answered, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.”\n",

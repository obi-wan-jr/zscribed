Joab fled to Yahweh’s Tent, and held onto the horns of the altar.\nKing Solomon was told, “Joab has fled to Yahweh’s Tent, and behold, he is by the altar.” Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, “Go, fall on him.”\nBenaiah came to Yahweh’s Tent, and said to him, “Thus says the king, ‘Come out!’”\nHe said, “No; but I will die here.”\nBenaiah brought the king word again, saying, “Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.”\nThe king said to him, “Do as he has said, and fall on him, and bury him; that you may take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father’s house.\nYahweh will return his blood on his own head, because he fell on two men more righteous and better than he, and killed them with the sword, and my father David didn’t know it: Abner the son of Ner, captain of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the army of Judah.\nSo their blood will return on the head of Joab, and on the head of his offspring forever. But for David, for his offspring, for his house, and for his throne, there will be peace forever from Yahweh.”\nThen Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and fell on him, and killed him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.\nThe king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army; and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.\nThe king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and live there, and don’t go anywhere else.\nFor on the day you go out and pass over the brook Kidron, know for certain that you will surely die. Your blood will be on your own head.”\nShimei said to the king, “What you say is good. As my lord the king has said, so will your servant do.” Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.\nAt the end of three years, two of Shimei’s slaves ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. They told Shimei, saying, “Behold, your slaves are in Gath.”\nShimei arose, saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his slaves; and Shimei went, and brought his slaves from Gath.\nSolomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had come again.\nThe king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, “Didn’t I adjure you by Yahweh, and warn you, saying, ‘Know for certain, that on the day you go out, and walk anywhere else, you shall surely die?’ You said to me, ‘The saying that I have heard is good.’\nWhy then have you not kept the oath of Yahweh, and the commandment that I have instructed you with?”\nThe king said moreover to Shimei, “You know in your heart all the wickedness that you did to David my father.

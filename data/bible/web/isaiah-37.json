He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.

He heard news concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “He has come out to fight against you.” When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, ‘Don’t let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, “Jerusalem won’t be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.” Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly.

Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?’” Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. Then Hezekiah went up to The LORD’s house, and spread it before The LORD. Hezekiah prayed to The LORD, saying, “The LORD of Armies, the God of Israel, who is enthroned among the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth. Turn your ear, The LORD, and hear. Open your eyes, The LORD, and behold. Hear all of the words of Sennacherib, who has sent to defy the living God.

Now therefore, The LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are The LORD, even you only.” Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “The LORD, the God of Israel says, ‘Because you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, this is the word which The LORD has spoken concerning him.

Will you deliver them into the hand of Israel?” But he didn’t answer him that day.\nSaul said, “Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people; and know and see in which this sin has been today.\nFor, as Yahweh lives, who saves Israel, though it is in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.” But there was not a man among all the people who answered him.\nThen he said to all Israel, “You be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.”\nThe people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.”\nTherefore Saul said to Yahweh, the God of Israel, “Show the right.”\nJonathan and Saul were chosen, but the people escaped.\nSaul said, “Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son.”\nJonathan was selected.\nThen Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done!”\nJonathan told him, and said, “I certainly did taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and behold, I must die.”\nSaul said, “God do so and more also; for you shall surely die, Jonathan.”\nThe people said to Saul, “Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far from it! As Yahweh lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has worked with God today!” So the people rescued Jonathan, that he didn’t die.\nThen Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.\nNow when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. Wherever he turned himself, he defeated them.\nHe did valiantly, and struck the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.\nNow the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal.\nThe name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.\nKish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.\nThere was severe war against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man, he took him into his service.\n",

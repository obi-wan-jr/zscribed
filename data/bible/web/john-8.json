When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own; for he is a liar, and the father of lies.\n\n\nBut because I tell the truth, you don’t believe me.\n\n\nWhich of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?\n\n\nHe who is of God hears the words of God. For this cause you don’t hear, because you are not of God.”\nThen the Jews answered him, “Don’t we say well that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?”\nJesus answered,\n“I don’t have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.\n\n\nBut I don’t seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges.\n\n\nMost certainly, I tell you, if a person keeps my word, he will never see death.”\nThen the Jews said to him, “Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and you say,\n‘If a man keeps my word, he will never taste of death.’\nAre you greater than our father, Abraham, who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to be?”\nJesus answered,\n“If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is our God.\n\n\nYou have not known him, but I know him. If I said, ‘I don’t know him,’ I would be like you, a liar. But I know him, and keep his word.\n\n\nYour father Abraham rejoiced to see my day. He saw it, and was glad.”\nThe Jews therefore said to him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?”\nJesus said to them,\n“Most certainly, I tell you, before Abraham came into existence, I AM.”\nTherefore they took up stones to throw at him, but Jesus was hidden, and went out of the temple, having gone through the middle of them, and so passed by.\n",

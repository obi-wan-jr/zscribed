When they came there to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily on him, and he prophesied among them. When all who knew him before saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said to one another, “What is this that has come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?” One of the same place answered, “Who is their father?” Therefore it became a proverb, “Is Saul also among the prophets?” When he had finished prophesying, he came to the high place.

He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families; and the family of the Matrites was chosen. Then Saul the son of Kish was chosen; but when they looked for him, he could not be found. Therefore they asked of The LORD further, “Is there yet a man to come here?” The LORD answered, “Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage.” They ran and got him there. When he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.

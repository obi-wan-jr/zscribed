The priest shall make atonement for him who is to be cleansed before Yahweh.”\nThis is the law for him in whom is the plague of leprosy, who is not able to afford the sacrifice for his cleansing.\nYahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,\n“When you have come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put a spreading mildew in a house in the land of your possession,\nthen he who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, ‘There seems to me to be some sort of plague in the house.’\nThe priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest goes in to examine the plague, that all that is in the house not be made unclean. Afterward the priest shall go in to inspect the house.\nHe shall examine the plague; and behold, if the plague is in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and it appears to be deeper than the wall;\nthen the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.\nThe priest shall come again on the seventh day, and look. If the plague has spread in the walls of the house,\nthen the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which is the plague, and cast them into an unclean place outside of the city:\nand he shall cause the inside of the house to be scraped all over, and they shall pour out the mortar, that they scraped off, outside of the city into an unclean place.\nThey shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.\n“If the plague comes again, and breaks out in the house, after he has taken out the stones, and after he has scraped the house, and after it was plastered;\nthen the priest shall come in and look; and behold, if the plague has spread in the house, it is a destructive mildew in the house. It is unclean.\nHe shall break down the house, its stones, and its timber, and all the house’s mortar. He shall carry them out of the city into an unclean place.\n“Moreover he who goes into the house while it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening.\nHe who lies down in the house shall wash his clothes; and he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes.\n“If the priest shall come in, and examine it, and behold, the plague hasn’t spread in the house, after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.\nTo cleanse the house he shall take two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.\nHe shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water.\nHe shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times.\nHe shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, with the living bird, with the cedar wood, with the hyssop, and with the scarlet;\nbut he shall let the living bird go out of the city into the open field. So shall he make atonement for the house; and it shall be clean.”\nThis is the law for any plague of leprosy, and for an itch,\nand for the destructive mildew of a garment, and for a house,\nand for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot;\nto teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean.\nThis is the law of leprosy.\n",

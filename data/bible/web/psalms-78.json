seas.\nHe let them fall in the middle of their camp,\naround their habitations.\nSo they ate, and were well filled.\nHe gave them their own desire.\nThey didn’t turn from their cravings.\nTheir food was yet in their mouths,\nwhen the anger of God went up against them,\nkilled some of their fattest,\nand struck down the young men of Israel.\nFor all this they still sinned,\nand didn’t believe in his wondrous works.\nTherefore he consumed their days in vanity,\nand their years in terror.\nWhen he killed them, then they inquired after him.\nThey returned and sought God earnestly.\nThey remembered that God was their rock,\nthe Most High God, their redeemer.\nBut they flattered him with their mouth,\nand lied to him with their tongue.\nFor their heart was not right with him,\nneither were they faithful in his covenant.\nBut he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them.\nYes, many times he turned his anger away,\nand didn’t stir up all his wrath.\nHe remembered that they were but flesh,\na wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again.\nHow often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,\nand grieved him in the desert!\nThey turned again and tempted God,\nand provoked the Holy One of Israel.\nThey didn’t remember his hand,\nnor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;\nhow he set his signs in Egypt,\nhis wonders in the field of Zoan,\nhe turned their rivers into blood,\nand their streams, so that they could not drink.\nHe sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;\nand frogs, which destroyed them.\nHe gave also their increase to the caterpillar,\nand their labor to the locust.\nHe destroyed their vines with hail,\ntheir sycamore fig trees with frost.\nHe gave over their livestock also to the hail,\nand their flocks to hot thunderbolts.\nHe threw on them the fierceness of his anger,\nwrath, indignation, and trouble,\nand a band of angels of evil.\nHe made a path for his anger.\nHe didn’t spare their soul from death,\nbut gave their life over to the pestilence,\nand struck all the firstborn in Egypt,\nthe chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.\nBut he led out his own people like sheep,\nand guided them in the wilderness like a flock.\nHe led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid,\nbut the sea overwhelmed their enemies.\nHe brought them to the border of his sanctuary,\nto this mountain, which his right hand had taken.\nHe also drove out the nations before them,\nallotted them for an inheritance by line,\nand made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.\nYet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,\nand didn’t keep his testimonies;\nbut turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.\nThey were twisted like a deceitful bow.\nFor they provoked him to anger with their high places,\nand moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.\nWhen God heard this, he was angry,\nand greatly abhorred Israel;\nSo that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh,\nthe tent which he placed among men;\nand delivered his strength into captivity,\nhis glory into the adversary’s hand.\nHe also gave his people over to the sword,\nand was angry with his inheritance.\nFire devoured their young men.\nTheir virgins had no wedding song.\nTheir priests fell by the sword,\nand their widows couldn’t weep.\nThen the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,\nlike a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.\nHe struck his adversaries backward.\nHe put them to a perpetual reproach.\nMoreover he rejected the tent of Joseph,\nand didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim,\nBut chose the tribe of Judah,\nMount Zion which he loved.\nHe built his sanctuary like the heights,\nlike the earth which he has established forever.\nHe also chose David his servant,\nand took him from the sheepfolds;\nfrom following the ewes that have their young,\nhe brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people,\nand Israel, his inheritance.\nSo he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,\nand guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.\n",

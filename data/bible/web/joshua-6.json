The trumpets sounded as they went.\nJoshua commanded the people, saying, “You shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout.”\nSo he caused Yahweh’s ark to go around the city, going about it once. Then they came into the camp, and stayed in the camp.\nJoshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up Yahweh’s ark.\nThe seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns in front of Yahweh’s ark went on continually, and blew the trumpets. The armed men went in front of them. The rear guard came after Yahweh’s ark. The trumpets sounded as they went.\nThe second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp. They did this six days.\nOn the seventh day, they rose early at the dawning of the day, and marched around the city in the same way seven times. Only on this day they marched around the city seven times.\nAt the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, “Shout, for Yahweh has given you the city!\nThe city shall be devoted, even it and all that is in it, to Yahweh.

  "text": "It was now two days before the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread, and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might seize him by deception, and kill him.\nFor they said, “Not during the feast, because there might be a riot among the people.”\nWhile he was at Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard—very costly. She broke the jar, and poured it over his head.\nBut there were some who were indignant among themselves, saying, “Why has this ointment been wasted?\nFor this might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii,\n and given to the poor.” They grumbled against her.\nBut Jesus said,\n“Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work for me.\n\n\nFor you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want to, you can do them good; but you will not always have me.\n\n\nShe has done what she could. She has anointed my body beforehand for the burying.\n\n\nMost certainly I tell you, wherever this Good News may be preached throughout the whole world, that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her.”\nJudas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them.\nThey, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. He sought how he might conveniently deliver him.\nOn the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover, his disciples asked him, “Where do you want us to go and prepare that you may eat the Passover?”\nHe sent two of his disciples, and said to them,\n“Go into the city, and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him,\n\n\nand wherever he enters in, tell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says, “Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’\n\n\nHe will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Get ready for us there.”\nHis disciples went out, and came into the city, and found things as he had said to them, and they prepared the Passover.\nWhen it was evening he came with the twelve.\nAs they sat and were eating, Jesus said,\n“Most certainly I tell you, one of you will betray me—he who eats with me.”\nThey began to be sorrowful, and to ask him one by one, “Surely not I?” And another said, “Surely not I?”\nHe answered them,\n“It is one of the twelve, he who dips with me in the dish.\n\n\nFor the Son of Man goes, even as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man if he had not been born.”\nAs they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had blessed, he broke it, and gave to them, and said,\n“Take, eat. This is my body.”\nHe took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them. They all drank of it.\nHe said to them,\n“This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many.\n\n\nMost certainly I tell you, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it anew in God’s Kingdom.”\nWhen they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.\nJesus said to them,\n“All of you will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’\n\nHowever, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.”\n\nBut Peter said to him, “Although all will be offended, yet I will not.”\nJesus said to him,\n“Most certainly I tell you, that you today, even this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.”\n\nBut he spoke all the more, “If I must die with you, I will not deny you.” They all said the same thing.\nThey came to a place which was named Gethsemane. He said to his disciples,\n“Sit here, while I pray.”\nHe took with him Peter, James, and John, and began to be greatly troubled and distressed.\nHe said to them,\n“My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch.”\nHe went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.\nHe said,\n“Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Please remove this cup from me. However, not what I desire, but what you desire.”\n\nHe came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter,\n“Simon, are you sleeping? Couldn’t you watch one hour?\n\n\nWatch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”\nAgain he went away, and prayed, saying the same words.\nAgain he returned, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they didn’t know what to answer him.\nHe came the third time, and said to them,\n“Sleep on now, and take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.\n\n\nArise, let us be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.”\n\nImmediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came—and with him a multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.\nNow he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, “Whomever I will kiss, that is he. Seize him, and lead him away safely.”\nWhen he had come, immediately he came to him, and said, “Rabbi! Rabbi!” and kissed him.\nThey laid their hands on him, and seized him.\nBut a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.\nJesus answered them,\n“Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me?\n\n\nI was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you didn’t arrest me. But this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.”\nThey all left him, and fled.\nA certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown around himself over his naked body. The young men grabbed him,\nbut he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.\nThey led Jesus away to the high priest. All the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes came together with him.\nPeter had followed him from a distance, until he came into the court of the high priest. He was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire.\nNow the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to death, and found none.\nFor many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony didn’t agree with each other.\nSome stood up, and gave false testimony against him, saying,\n“We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.’”\nEven so, their testimony did not agree.\nThe high priest stood up in the middle, and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer? What is it which these testify against you?”\nBut he stayed quiet, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?”\nJesus said,\n“I am. You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky.”\nThe high priest tore his clothes, and said, “What further need have we of witnesses?\nYou have heard the blasphemy! What do you think?” They all condemned him to be worthy of death.\nSome began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him, “Prophesy!” The officers struck him with the palms of their hands.\nAs Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maids of the high priest came,\nand seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, “You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus!”\nBut he denied it, saying, “I neither know, nor understand what you are saying.” He went out on the porch, and the rooster crowed.\nThe maid saw him, and began again to tell those who stood by, “This is one of them.”\nBut he again denied it. After a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, “You truly are one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it.”\nBut he began to curse, and to swear, “I don’t know this man of whom you speak!”\nThe rooster crowed the second time. Peter remembered the word, how that Jesus said to him,\n“Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” When he thought about that, he wept.\n",

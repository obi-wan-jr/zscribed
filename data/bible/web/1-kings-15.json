There was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. Abijam slept with his fathers, and they buried him in David’s city; and Asa his son reigned in his place. In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa began to reign over Judah. He reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom. Asa did that which was right in The LORD’s eyes, as David his father did. He put away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. He also removed Maacah his mother from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah. Asa cut down her image and burned it at the brook Kidron.

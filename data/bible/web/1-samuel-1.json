This man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to The LORD of Armies in Shiloh. The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to The LORD, were there.

Her rival provoked her severely, to irritate her, because The LORD had shut up her womb. As he did so year by year, when she went up to The LORD’s house. Her rival provoked her; therefore she wept, and didn’t eat. Elkanah her husband said to her, \"Hannah, why do you weep? Why don’t you eat? Why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?\" So Hannah rose up after they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of The LORD’s temple. She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to The LORD, weeping bitterly. She vowed a vow, and said, \"The LORD of Armies, if you will indeed look at the affliction of your servant, and remember me, and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a boy, then I will give him to The LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall come on his head.\" As she continued praying before The LORD, Eli saw her mouth. Now Hannah spoke in her heart. Only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she was drunk. Eli said to her, \"How long will you be drunk? Get rid of your wine!\" Hannah answered, \"No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have not been drinking wine or strong drink, but I poured out my soul before The LORD.

I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.” So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two stone tablets like the first, and went up onto the mountain, having the two tablets in my hand. He wrote on the tablets, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which The LORD spoke to you on the mountain out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly: and The LORD gave them to me. I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tablets in the ark which I had made; and there they are as The LORD commanded me. (The children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his place. From there they traveled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water. At that time The LORD set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of The LORD’s covenant, to stand before The LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day. Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers; The LORD is his inheritance, according as The LORD your God spoke to him.)

Behold, to The LORD your God belongs heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that is therein.

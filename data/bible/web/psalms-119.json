me in your ways\nFulfill your promise to your servant, that you may be feared\nTake away my disgrace that I dread, for your ordinances are good\nBehold, I long for your precepts\nRevive me in your righteousness\nLet your loving kindness also come to me, The LORD, your salvation, according to your word\nSo I will have an answer for him who reproaches me, for I trust in your word\nDon’t snatch the word of truth out of my mouth, for I put my hope in your ordinances\nSo I will obey your law continually, forever and ever\nI will walk in liberty, for I have sought your precepts\nI will also speak of your statutes before kings, and will not be disappointed\nI will delight myself in your commandments, because I love them\nI reach out my hands for your commandments, which I love\nI will meditate on your statutes\nRemember your word to your servant, because you gave me hope\nThis is my comfort in my affliction, for your word has revived me\nThe arrogant mock me excessively, but I don’t swerve from your law\nI remember your ordinances of old, The LORD, and have comforted myself\nIndignation has taken hold on me, because of the wicked who forsake your law\nYour statutes have

your statutes\nThe law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of pieces of gold and silver\nYour hands have made me and formed me\nGive me understanding, that I may learn your commandments\nThose who fear you will see me and be glad, because I have put my hope in your word\nThe LORD, I know that your judgments are righteous, that in faithfulness you have afflicted me\nPlease let your loving kindness be for my comfort, according to your word to your servant\nLet your tender mercies come to me, that I may live; for your law is my delight\nLet the proud be disappointed, for they have overthrown me wrongfully\nI will meditate on your precepts\nLet those who fear you turn to me\nThey will know your statutes\nLet my heart be blameless toward your decrees,

smoke\nI don’t forget your statutes\nHow many are the days of your servant\nWhen will you execute judgment on those who persecute me\nThe proud have dug pits for me, contrary to your law\nAll of your commandments are faithful\nThey persecute me wrongfully\nHelp me\nThey had almost wiped me from the earth, but I didn’t forsake your precepts\nPreserve my life according to your loving kindness, so I will obey the statutes of your mouth\nThe LORD, your word is settled in heaven forever\nYour faithfulness is to all generations\nYou have established the earth, and it remains\nYour laws remain to this day, for all things serve you\nUnless your law had been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction\nI will never forget your precepts, for with them, you have revived me\nI am yours\nSave me, for I have sought your precepts\nThe wicked have waited for me, to destroy me\nI will consider your statutes\nI have seen a limit to all perfection, but your commands are boundless\nHow I love your law\nIt is my meditation all day\nYour commandments make me wiser than my enemies, for your commandments are always with me\nI have more understanding than all my teachers, for your testimonies

ordinances, for you have taught me\nHow sweet are your promises to my taste, more than honey to my mouth\nThrough your precepts, I get understanding; therefore I hate every false way\nYour word is a lamp to my feet, and a light for my path\nI have sworn, and have confirmed it, that I will obey your righteous ordinances\nI am afflicted very much\nRevive me, The LORD, according to your word\nAccept, I beg you, the willing offerings of my mouth\nThe LORD, teach me your ordinances\nMy soul is continually in my hand, yet I won’t forget your law\nThe wicked have laid a snare for me, yet

end\nI hate double-minded men, but I love your law\nYou are my hiding place and my shield\nI hope in your word\nDepart from me, you evildoers, that I may keep the commandments of my God\nUphold me according to your word, that I may live\nLet me not be ashamed of my hope\nHold me up, and I will be safe, and will have respect for your statutes continually\nYou reject all those who stray from your statutes, for their deceit is in vain\nYou put away all the wicked of the earth like dross\nTherefore I love your testimonies\nMy flesh trembles for fear of you\nI am afraid of your judgments\nI have done what is just and righteous\nDon’t leave me to my oppressors\nEnsure your servant’s well-being\nDon’t let the proud oppress me\nMy eyes fail looking for your salvation, for your righteous word\nDeal with your servant according to your loving kindness\nTeach me your statutes\nI am your servant\nGive me understanding, that I may know your testimonies\nIt is time to act, The LORD, for they break your law\nTherefore I love your commandments more than gold, yes, more than pure gold\nTherefore I consider all of your precepts to be right\nI hate every false way\nYour testimonies are wonderful, therefore my soul keeps them\nThe entrance of your words gives light\nIt gives understanding to the simple\nI opened my mouth wide and panted, for I longed for your commandments\nTurn to me, and have mercy on me, as you always do to those who love your name\nEstablish my footsteps in your word\nDon’t let any iniquity have dominion over me\nRedeem me from the oppression of man, so I will observe your precepts\nMake your face shine on your servant\nTeach me your statutes\nStreams of tears run down my eyes, because they don’t observe your law\nYou are righteous, The LORD\nYour judgments are upright\nYou have commanded your statutes in righteousness\nThey are fully trustworthy\nMy zeal wears me out, because my enemies ignore your words\nYour promises have been thoroughly tested, and your servant loves them\nI am small and despised\nI don’t forget your precepts\nYour righteousness is an everlasting righteousness\nYour law is truth\nTrouble and anguish have taken hold of me\nYour commandments are my delight\nYour testimonies are righteous forever\nGive me understanding, that I may live\nI have called with my whole heart\nAnswer me, The LORD\nI will keep your statutes\nI have called to you\nSave me\nI will obey your statutes\nI rise before dawn and cry for help\nI put my hope in your words\nMy eyes stay open through the night watches, that I might meditate on your word\nHear my voice according to your loving kindness\nRevive me, The LORD, according to your ordinances\nThey draw near who follow after wickedness\nThey are far from your law\nYou are near, The LORD\nAll your commandments are truth\nOf old I have known from your testimonies, that you have founded them forever\nConsider my affliction, and deliver me, for I don’t forget your law\nPlead my cause, and redeem me\nRevive me according to your promise\nSalvation is far from the wicked, for they don’t seek your statutes\nGreat are your tender mercies, The LORD\nRevive me according to your ordinances\nMany are my persecutors and my adversaries\nI haven’t swerved from your testimonies\nI look at the faithless with loathing, because they don’t observe your word\nConsider how I love your precepts\nRevive me, The LORD, according to your loving kindness\nAll of your words are truth\nEvery one of your righteous ordinances endures forever\nPrinces have persecuted me without a cause, but my heart stands in awe of your words\nI rejoice at your word, as one who finds great plunder\nI hate and abhor falsehood\nI love your law\nSeven times a day, I praise you, because of your righteous ordinances\nThose who love your law have great peace\nNothing causes them to stumble\nI have hoped for your salvation, The LORD\nI have done your commandments\nMy soul has observed your testimonies\nI love them exceedingly\nI have obeyed your precepts and your testimonies, for all my ways are before you\nLet my cry come before you, The LORD\nGive me understanding according to your word\nLet my supplication come before you\nDeliver me according to your word\nLet my lips utter praise, for you teach me your statutes\nLet my tongue sing of your word, for all your commandments are righteousness\nLet your hand be ready to help me, for I have chosen your precepts\nI have longed for your salvation, The LORD\nYour law is my delight\nLet my soul live, that I may praise you\nLet your ordinances help me\nI have gone astray like a lost sheep\nSeek your servant, for I don’t forget your commandments",

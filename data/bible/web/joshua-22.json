When they came to the region about the Jordan, that is in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan, a great altar to look at.

The children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest. With him were ten princes, one prince of a fathers’ house for each of the tribes of Israel; and they were each head of their fathers’ houses among the thousands of Israel. They came to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying, “Thus says the whole congregation of The LORD, ‘What trespass is this that you have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away today from following The LORD, in that you have built yourselves an altar, to rebel today against The LORD?

Didn’t Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? That man didn’t perish alone in his iniquity.’” Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel, “The Mighty One, God, The LORD, the Mighty One, God, The LORD, he knows; and Israel shall know: if it was in rebellion, or if in trespass against The LORD (don’t save us today), that we have built us an altar to turn away from following The LORD; or if to offer burnt offering or meal offering, or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings, let The LORD himself require it. “If we have not out of concern done this, and for a reason, saying, ‘In time to come your children might speak to our children, saying, “What have you to do with The LORD, the God of Israel? For The LORD has made the Jordan a border between us and you, you children of Reuben and children of Gad.

The thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and spoke no more of going up against them to war, to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben and the children of Gad lived. The children of Reuben and the children of Gad named the altar “A Witness Between Us that The LORD is God.”",

  "text": "Now when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed,\nI put my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the fortress, in charge of Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.\nI said to them, “Don’t let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while they stand guard, let them shut the doors, and you bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, everyone in his watch, with everyone near his house.”\nNow the city was wide and large; but the people were few therein, and the houses were not built.\nMy God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be listed by genealogy. I found the book of the genealogy of those who came up at the first, and I found this written in it:\nThese are the children of the province, who went up out of the captivity of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and who returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, everyone to his city;\nwho came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah.\nThe number of the men of the people of Israel:\nThe children of Parosh, two thousand one hundred seventy-two.\nThe children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy-two.\nThe children of Arah, six hundred fifty-two.\nThe children of Pahathmoab, of the children of Jeshua and Joab, two thousand eight hundred eighteen.\nThe children of Elam, one thousand two hundred fifty-four.\nThe children of Zattu, eight hundred forty-five.\nThe children of Zaccai, seven hundred sixty.\nThe children of Binnui, six hundred forty-eight.\nThe children of Bebai, six hundred twenty-eight.\nThe children of Azgad, two thousand three hundred twenty-two.\nThe children of Adonikam, six hundred sixty-seven.\nThe children of Bigvai, two thousand sixty-seven.\nThe children of Adin, six hundred fifty-five.\nThe children of Ater, of Hezekiah, ninety-eight.\nThe children of Hashum, three hundred twenty-eight.\nThe children of Bezai, three hundred twenty-four.\nThe children of Hariph, one hundred twelve.\nThe children of Gibeon, ninety-five.\nThe men of Bethlehem and Netophah, one hundred eighty-eight.\nThe men of Anathoth, one hundred twenty-eight.\nThe men of Beth Azmaveth, forty-two.\nThe men of Kiriath Jearim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven hundred forty-three.\nThe men of Ramah and Geba, six hundred twenty-one.\nThe men of Michmas, one hundred twenty-two.\nThe men of Bethel and Ai, one hundred twenty-three.\nThe men of the other Nebo, fifty-two.\nThe children of the other Elam, one thousand two hundred fifty-four.\nThe children of Harim, three hundred twenty.\nThe children of Jericho, three hundred forty-five.\nThe children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty-one.\nThe children of Senaah, three thousand nine hundred thirty.\nThe priests: The children of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine hundred seventy-three.\nThe children of Immer, one thousand fifty-two.\nThe children of Pashhur, one thousand two hundred forty-seven.\nThe children of Harim, one thousand seventeen.\nThe Levites: the children of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, of the children of Hodevah, seventy-four.\nThe singers: the children of Asaph, one hundred forty-eight.\nThe gatekeepers: the children of Shallum, the children of Ater, the children of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the children of Hatita, the children of Shobai, one hundred thirty-eight.\nThe temple servants: the children of Ziha, the children of Hasupha, the children of Tabbaoth,\nthe children of Keros, the children of Sia, the children of Padon,\nthe children of Lebana, the children of Hagaba, the children of Salmai,\nthe children of Hanan, the children of Giddel, the children of Gahar,\nthe children of Reaiah, the children of Rezin, the children of Nekoda,\nthe children of Gazzam, the children of Uzza, the children of Paseah.\nThe children of Besai, the children of Meunim, the children of Nephushesim,\nthe children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children of Harhur,\nthe children of Bazlith, the children of Mehida, the children of Harsha,\nthe children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of Temah,\nthe children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha.\nThe children of Solomon’s servants: the children of Sotai, the children of Sophereth, the children of Perida,\nthe children of Jaala, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel,\nthe children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth Hazzebaim, the children of Amon.\nAll the temple servants, and the children of Solomon’s servants, were three hundred ninety-two.\nThese were those who went up from Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer; but they could not show their fathers’ houses, nor their offspring, whether they were of Israel:\nThe children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty-two.\nOf the priests: the children of Hobaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name.\nThese searched for their genealogical records, but couldn’t find them.

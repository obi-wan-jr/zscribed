In Jerusalem lived of the children of Judah, of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim and Manasseh: Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the children of Perez the son of Judah. Of the Shilonites: Asaiah the firstborn, and his sons. Of the sons of Zerah: Jeuel and their brothers, six hundred ninety.

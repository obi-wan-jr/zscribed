Ahab said to Obadiah, \"Go through the land, to all the springs of water, and to all the brooks.

He recognized him, and fell on his face, and said, \"Is it you, my lord Elijah?\" He answered him, \"It is I. Go, tell your lord, 'Behold, Elijah is here!’\" He said, \"How have I sinned, that you would deliver your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me?

But I, your servant, have feared The LORD from my youth. Wasn’t it told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed The LORD’s prophets, how I hid one hundred men of The LORD’s prophets with fifty to a cave, and fed them with bread and water? Now you say, 'Go, tell your lord, \"Behold, Elijah is here\".’ He will kill me.\" Elijah said, \"As The LORD of Armies lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today.\" So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him; and Ahab went to meet Elijah.

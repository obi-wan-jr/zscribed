Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, \"Boil the meat at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, 'Aaron and his sons shall eat it.’ What remains of the meat and of the bread you shall burn with fire. You shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting for seven days, until the days of your consecration are fulfilled: for he shall consecrate you seven days. What has been done today, so The LORD has commanded to do, to make atonement for you. You shall stay at the door of the Tent of Meeting day and night seven days, and keep The LORD’s command, that you don’t die: for so I am commanded.\" Aaron and his sons did all the things which The LORD commanded by Moses.",

ambushes;\nfor Yahweh has both purposed and done\nthat which he spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.\nYou who dwell on many waters, abundant in treasures,\nyour end has come, the measure of your covetousness.\nYahweh of Armies has sworn by himself, saying,\n‘Surely I will fill you with men,\nas with the canker worm;\nand they will lift up a shout against you.’\n“He has made the earth by his power.\nHe has established the world by his wisdom.\nBy his understanding he has stretched out the heavens.\nWhen he utters his voice,\nthere is a roar of waters in the heavens,\nand he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth.\nHe makes lightning for the rain,\nand brings the wind out of his treasuries.\n“Every man has become brutish without knowledge.\nEvery goldsmith is disappointed by his image;\nfor his molten image is falsehood,\nand there is no breath in them.\nThey are vanity,\na work of delusion.\nIn the time of their visitation, they will perish.\nThe portion of Jacob is not like these,\nfor he is the former of all things;\nincluding the tribe of his inheritance:\nYahweh of Armies is his name.\n“You are my battle ax and weapons of war.\nWith you I will break the nations into pieces.\nWith you I will destroy kingdoms.\nWith you I will break in pieces\nthe horse and his rider.\nWith you I will break in pieces\nthe chariot and him who rides therein.\nWith you I will break in pieces\nman and woman.\nWith you I will break in pieces\nthe old man and the youth.\nWith you I will break in pieces\nthe young man and the virgin.\nWith you I will break in pieces\nthe shepherd and his flock.\nWith you I will break in pieces\nthe farmer and his yoke.\nWith you will I break in pieces\ngovernors and deputies.\n“I will render to Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight,” says Yahweh.\n“Behold, I am against you, destroying mountain,” says Yahweh,\n“which destroys all the earth.\nI will stretch out my hand on you,\nroll you down from the rocks,\nand will make you a burned mountain.\nThey won’t take a cornerstone from you,\nnor a stone for foundations;\nbut you will be desolate for ever,” says Yahweh.\n“Set up a standard in the land!\nBlow the trumpet among the nations!\nPrepare the nations against her!\nCall together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz!\nAppoint a marshal against her!\nCause the horses to come up as the rough canker worm!\nPrepare against her the nations,\nthe kings of the Medes, its governors, and all its deputies, and all the land of their dominion!\nThe land trembles and is in pain;\nfor the purposes of Yahweh against Babylon stand,\nto make the land of Babylon a desolation, without inhabitant.\nThe mighty men of Babylon have stopped fighting,\nthey remain in their strongholds.\nTheir might has failed.\nThey have become as women.\nHer dwelling places are set on fire.\nHer bars are broken.\nOne runner will run to meet another,\nand one messenger to meet another,\nto show the king of Babylon that his city is taken on every quarter.\nSo the passages are seized.\nThey have burned the reeds with fire.\nThe men of war are frightened.”\nFor Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says:\n“The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time when it is trodden.\nYet a little while, and the time of harvest comes for her.”\n“Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me.\nHe has crushed me.\nHe has made me an empty vessel.\nHe has, like a monster, swallowed me up.\nHe has filled his mouth with my delicacies.\nHe has cast me out.\nMay the violence done to me and to my flesh be on Babylon!”\nthe inhabitant of Zion will say; and,\n“May my blood be on the inhabitants of Chaldea!”\nwill Jerusalem say.\nTherefore Yahweh says:\n“Behold, I will plead your cause,\nand take vengeance for you.\nI will dry up her sea,\nand make her fountain dry.\nBabylon will become heaps,\na dwelling place for jackals,\nan astonishment, and a hissing,\nwithout inhabitant.\nThey will roar together like young lions.\nThey will growl as lions’ cubs.\nWhen they are heated, I will make their feast,\nand I will make them drunk,\nthat they may rejoice,\nand sleep a perpetual sleep,\nand not wake up,” says Yahweh.\n“I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter,\nlike rams with male goats.\n“How Sheshach is taken!\nHow the praise of the whole earth seized!\nHow Babylon has become a desolation among the nations!\nThe sea has come up on Babylon.\nShe is covered with the multitude of its waves.\nHer cities have become a desolation,\na dry land, and a desert,\na land in which no man dwells.\nNo son of man passes by it.\nI will execute judgment on Bel in Babylon,\nand I will bring out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up.\nThe nations will not flow any more to him.\nYes, the wall of Babylon will fall.\n“My people, go away from the middle of her,\nand each of you save yourselves from Yahweh’s fierce anger.\nDon’t let your heart faint.\nDon’t fear for the news that will be heard in the land.\nFor news will come one year,\nand after that in another year news will come,\nand violence in the land,\nruler against ruler.\nTherefore behold, the days come that I will execute judgment on the engraved images of Babylon;\nand her whole land will be confounded.\nAll her slain will fall in the middle of her.\nThen the heavens and the earth,\nand all that is therein,\nwill sing for joy over Babylon;\nfor the destroyers will come to her from the north,” says Yahweh.\n“As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall,\nso the slain of all the land will fall at Babylon.\nYou who have escaped the sword, go!\nDon’t stand still!\nRemember Yahweh from afar,\nand let Jerusalem come into your mind.”\n“We are confounded,\nbecause we have heard reproach.\nConfusion has covered our faces,\nfor strangers have come into the sanctuaries of Yahweh’s house.”\n“Therefore behold, the days come,” says Yahweh,\n“that I will execute judgment on her engraved images;\nand through all her land the wounded will groan.\nThough Babylon should mount up to the sky,\nand though she should fortify the height of her strength,\nyet destroyers will come to her from me,” says Yahweh.\n“The sound of a cry comes from Babylon,\nand of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!\nFor Yahweh lays Babylon waste,\nand destroys out of her the great voice!\nTheir waves roar like many waters.\nThe noise of their voice is uttered.\nFor the destroyer has come on her,\neven on Babylon.\nHer mighty men are taken.\nTheir bows are broken in pieces,\nfor Yahweh is a God of retribution.\nHe will surely repay.\nI will make her princes, her wise men,\nher governors, her deputies, and her mighty men drunk.\nThey will sleep a perpetual sleep,\nand not wake up,”\nsays the King, whose name is Yahweh of Armies.\nYahweh of Armies says:\n“The wide walls of Babylon will be utterly overthrown.\nHer high gates will be burned with fire.\nThe peoples will labor for vanity,\nand the nations for the fire;\nand they will be weary.”\nThe word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was chief quartermaster.\nJeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come on Babylon, even all these words that are written concerning Babylon.\nJeremiah said to Seraiah, “When you come to Babylon, then see that you read all these words,\nand say, ‘Yahweh, you have spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, that no one will dwell in it, neither man nor animal, but that it will be desolate forever.’\nIt will be, when you have finished reading this book, that you shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into the middle of the Euphrates.\nThen you shall say, ‘Thus will Babylon sink, and will not rise again because of the evil that I will bring on her; and they will be weary.’”\nThus far are the words of Jeremiah.\n",

There will be weeping and the gnashing of teeth.\n\n\nThen the righteous will shine like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\n\n“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like treasure hidden in the field, which a man found, and hid. In his joy, he goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.\n\n“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a merchant seeking fine pearls,\n\n\nwho having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.\n\n“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet, that was cast into the sea, and gathered some fish of every kind,\n\n\nwhich, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach. They sat down, and gathered the good into containers, but the bad they threw away.\n\n\nSo will it be in the end of the world. The angels will come and separate the wicked from among the righteous,\n\n\nand will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.”\nJesus said to them,\n“Have you understood all these things?”\n\nThey answered him, “Yes, Lord.”\nHe said to them,\n“Therefore every scribe who has been made a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings out of his treasure new and old things.”\nWhen Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there.\nComing into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom, and these mighty works?\nIsn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother called Mary, and his brothers, James, Joses, Simon, and Judas?\nAren’t all of his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all of these things?”\nThey were offended by him.\nBut Jesus said to them,\n“A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house.”\nHe didn’t do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.\n",

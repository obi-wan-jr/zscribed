They don’t toil, neither do they spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.\n\n\nBut if this is how God clothes the grass in the field, which today exists, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith?\n\n\nDon’t seek what you will eat or what you will drink; neither be anxious.\n\n\nFor the nations of the world seek after all of these things, but your Father knows that you need these things.\n\n\nBut seek God’s Kingdom, and all these things will be added to you.\n\n\nDon’t be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.\n\n\nSell that which you have, and give gifts to the needy. Make for yourselves purses which don’t grow old, a treasure in the heavens that doesn’t fail, where no thief approaches, neither moth destroys.\n\n\nFor where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\n\n\n“Let your waist be dressed and your lamps burning.\n\n\nBe like men watching for their lord, when he returns from the marriage feast; that, when he comes and knocks, they may immediately open to him.\n\n\nBlessed are those servants, whom the lord will find watching when he comes. Most certainly I tell you, that he will dress himself, and make them recline, and will come and serve them.\n\n\nThey will be blessed if he comes in the second or third watch, and finds them so.\n\n\nBut know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and not allowed his house to be broken into.\n\n\nTherefore be ready also, for the Son of Man is coming in an hour that you don’t expect him.”\nPeter said to him, “Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everybody?”\nThe Lord said,\n“Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the right times?\n\n\nBlessed is that servant whom his lord will find doing so when he comes.\n\n\nTruly I tell you, that he will set him over all that he has.\n\n\nBut if that servant says in his heart, ‘My lord delays his coming,’ and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken,\n\n\nthen the lord of that servant will come in a day when he isn’t expecting him, and in an hour that he doesn’t know, and will cut him in two, and place his portion with the unfaithful.\n\n\nThat servant, who knew his lord’s will, and didn’t prepare, nor do what he wanted, will be beaten with many stripes,\n\n\nbut he who didn’t know, and did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few stripes. To whomever much is given, of him will much be required; and to whom much was entrusted, of him more will be asked.\n\n\n“I came to throw fire on the earth. I wish it were already kindled.\n\n\nBut I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!\n\n\nDo you think that I have come to give peace in the earth? I tell you, no, but rather division.\n\n\nFor from now on, there will be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.\n\n\nThey will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.”\n\n\nHe said to the multitudes also, “When you see a cloud rising from the west, immediately you say, ‘A shower is coming,’ and so it happens.\n\n\nWhen a south wind blows, you say, ‘There will be a scorching heat,’ and it happens.\n\n\nYou hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, but how is it that you don’t interpret this time?\n\n\nWhy don’t you judge for yourselves what is right?\n\n\nFor when you are going with your adversary before the magistrate, try diligently on the way to be released from him, lest perhaps he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.\n\n\nI tell you, you will by no means get out of there, until you have paid the very last penny.”\n",

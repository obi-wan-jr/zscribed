# Progress

What Works:
- ✅ Complete Bible audio creation system with full UI/UX implementation
- ✅ Real-time progress tracking with visual indicators and SSE
- ✅ Voice model loading and selection (Fish.Audio API + config fallback)
- ✅ Job queue management with proper error handling and recovery
- ✅ File output management with refresh, rename, and delete capabilities
- ✅ Authentication system with user management and session handling
- ✅ Support for entire books and multiple chapters with per-chapter processing
- ✅ Fish.Audio API integration with comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Bible text fetching and processing (WEB translation, local data)
- ✅ Audio file generation and storage with proper naming conventions
- ✅ Progress tracking via EventSource with fallback indicators
- ✅ Cache-busting for JavaScript files to ensure updates
- ✅ Video generation capabilities with background image/video support
- ✅ Admin panel with comprehensive logging, debug sessions, and user management
- ✅ Multi-job processing system with fair scheduling and recovery
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and troubleshooting
- ✅ File upload system for video backgrounds
- ✅ Job cancellation and recovery mechanisms
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of orphaned files and old sessions

What's Left to Build:
- **PLANNED: Video captioning feature with text-based timing and GStreamer integration**
- Additional Bible translations beyond WEB
- Enhanced audio file management features (batch operations, metadata)
- Performance optimization for very large books (e.g., Psalms with 150 chapters)
- Advanced video generation features (captions, synchronization)
- Export/import functionality for configurations and preferences
- Backup and restore capabilities for user data

Known Issues:
- None currently - all major functionality is working as designed
- Monitor performance for very large books (e.g., Psalms with 150 chapters)
- Consider implementing rate limiting for Fish.Audio API calls
- May need optimization for concurrent processing on Raspberry Pi hardware

Recent Achievements:
- Complete implementation of Bible audio creation workflow
- Real-time progress tracking with visual feedback
- Voice model loading and selection with fallback mechanisms
- Job queue management with proper error handling
- File output management with refresh capabilities
- Authentication system with user management
- Video generation with background support
- Admin panel with comprehensive monitoring tools
- Multi-job processing with recovery mechanisms
- Automatic cleanup and maintenance features

Technical Status:
- Server: Fully functional Node.js Express server with SSE, job queue, and recovery
- Frontend: Complete vanilla JS + TailwindCSS implementation with dark theme
- TTS: Fish.Audio integration with comprehensive error handling
- Bible: Local data provider with WEB translation and validation
- Video: FFmpeg-based video generation with background support
- Auth: Session-based authentication with user management
- Admin: Comprehensive monitoring and management tools
- Deployment: PM2-based deployment on Raspberry Pi with git workflow
- **PLANNED: Caption Engine: Text-based timing estimation with GStreamer video overlay**
